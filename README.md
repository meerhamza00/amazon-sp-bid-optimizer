🛠️ **Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up and Using the Bid Optimizer**

Follow these instructions carefully to set up and use the Amazon Sponsored Products Bid Optimizer.

**Step 1: Install Required Software (One-Time Setup)**

You only need to perform this software installation step once on your computer.

1.  **Download and Install VSCode (Visual Studio Code):**
    *   **What is VSCode?** VSCode is a free and popular code editor that we will use to run the bid optimizer script. Think of it as a special type of text editor designed for working with code.
    *   **How to Install:**
        *   Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in your web browser.
        *   Click the big blue "Download" button for **macOS** (since you are using an M1 Macbook Pro).
        *   Find the downloaded file (usually in your "Downloads" folder) and double-click it to run the installer.
        *   Follow the on-screen instructions to install VSCode. You can generally click "Next" or "Continue" for most options to use the default settings.

2.  **Download and Install Python:**
    *   **What is Python?** Python is a programming language that the bid optimizer script is written in. You need to install Python on your computer to run the script.
    *   **How to Install:**
        *   Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in your web browser.
        *   Click the button labeled "Download Python" (it will download the latest version, usually "Download Python 3.x.x").
        *   Find the downloaded file and double-click it to run the installer.
        *   **Important!** During the installation process, **look for a checkbox that says "Add Python to PATH" and make sure to CHECK this box.** This is crucial for the script to work correctly.
        *   Click "Install Now" and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

**Step 2: Set Up Your Project Folder and Files**

1.  **Create a New Project Folder:**
    *   Choose a location on your computer where you want to keep your project files (e.g., your "Documents" folder, Desktop, or a dedicated folder for projects).
    *   Right-click in an empty area within that location.
    *   Select "New" -> "Folder" (or "New Folder").
    *   Name the new folder `AmazonBidOptimizer`. This will be your project folder.

2.  **Open VSCode and Open Your Project Folder:**
    *   Launch the VSCode application that you installed in Step 1.
    *   In VSCode, click on the "File" menu at the top of the screen.
    *   Select "Open Folder..." (or "Code" -> "Open Folder..." on macOS).
    *   Navigate to the `AmazonBidOptimizer` folder you just created and select it. Click "Open" or "Select Folder". VSCode will now open your project folder.

3.  **Place the Script File (`bid_optimizer.py`) and `requirements.txt` File into Your Project Folder:**
    *   You should have two files provided to you:
        *   `bid_optimizer.py` (This is the main Python script for the bid optimizer).
        *   `requirements.txt` (This file lists the extra Python tools needed).
    *   **Copy or Move** both `bid_optimizer.py` and `requirements.txt` into the `AmazonBidOptimizer` folder you opened in VSCode. You should see these files listed in the left-hand "Explorer" panel in VSCode.

4.  **Install Extra Tools (Python Packages) Using `requirements.txt`:**
    *   VSCode has a built-in "Terminal" which lets you type commands directly into your computer. To open it:
        *   In VSCode, click on the "View" menu at the top.
        *   Select "Terminal" (or "Terminal" -> "New Terminal"). A "Terminal" window will appear at the bottom of VSCode.
    *   In the "Terminal" window, **type the following command exactly** and then press the `Enter` key on your keyboard:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

        *   **What this command does:** This command tells Python to use a tool called `pip` (which is like an app store for Python tools) to install all the "packages" (extra tools) that are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. In this case, it will install `pandas`, `numpy`, and `fpdf2`, which are needed for the bid optimizer script to work.
        *   **Wait for it to finish:** You will see messages in the Terminal as `pip` downloads and installs the packages. **Wait until you see a message that says "Successfully installed..." or similar, indicating that the installation is complete.** This might take a few moments depending on your internet speed.

**Step 3: Get Your Amazon Advertising Data (Bulksheet Export) - Creating Your Input File**

This step is crucial! You need to get your advertising data from Amazon in the correct format so the script can understand it. This data will be saved in a file called **your input file**.

1.  **Log in to Your Amazon Advertising Account:** Access your Amazon Seller Central or Amazon Advertising console.

2.  **Navigate to the "Campaigns" Section:** Find the section where you manage your Sponsored Products campaigns.

3.  **Go to "Bulksheets":** Look for the "Bulksheets" option, often found in the navigation menu (sometimes under "Campaigns" or at the top).

4.  **Create a New Bulksheet Export - **IMPORTANT SETTINGS!**
    *   Choose to export a "Sponsored Products Campaigns" bulksheet.
    *   **Critical Settings - Make Sure These Are Exact:**
        *   **Entity:**  In the export settings, find the "Entity" dropdown menu and **select "keyword and product targeting"**. **This is absolutely essential!** If you choose a different entity type, the script will not work correctly.
        *   **Date Range:** Choose the time period for the data you want to analyze. Common choices are "Last 7 Days" or "Last 30 Days".  A longer date range (like 30 days) generally provides more data for the script to work with.
        *   **Exclude Unwanted Data (Optional but Recommended):**
            *   **Campaigns you don't want to optimize:** If you have specific campaigns you manage manually, exclude them.
            *   **Paused Campaigns, Keywords, and Targets:** There's no need to include paused items in the export.

    *   **Example of Correct Export Settings:**  Your export settings should look something like this:

        ```
        Export Type: Sponsored Products Campaigns
        Entity: keyword and product targeting
        Date Range: [Your Chosen Date Range, e.g., Last 30 Days]
        Include Columns for: [Usually default - ensure you are getting metrics like Spend, Sales, Orders, Clicks, ROAS, Impressions, Bid]
        Exclude: [Campaigns you don't want to optimize, Paused Campaigns, Paused Keywords/Targets]
        ```

    *   Click "Create Bulksheet" or "Generate Report" and then download the generated CSV file.

5.  **Download the Bulksheet CSV File:** Amazon will create a file in **CSV format (.csv file extension)**. Download this file to your computer.

6.  **Move and Rename the Bulksheet File to Create Your Input File:**
    *   Locate the CSV file you downloaded (likely in your "Downloads" folder).
    *   **Copy or Move** this CSV file into your `AmazonBidOptimizer` project folder (the same folder where `bid_optimizer.py` and `requirements.txt` are).
    *   **Rename** the CSV file to `yourinput_file.csv`. **This exact name is crucial!** The script is designed to look for a file with this specific name as its input.

**Your Input File is Now Ready!** It's a CSV file named `yourinput_file.csv` in your `AmazonBidOptimizer` folder, containing your Amazon Sponsored Products data with the correct columns and format.  **It MUST contain the following columns (exactly as named):**

*   `Campaign Name (Informational only)`
*   `Portfolio Name (Informational only)`
*   `Campaign State (Informational only)`
*   `Bid`
*   `Ad Group Default Bid (Informational only)`
*   `Spend`
*   `Sales`
*   `Orders`
*   `Clicks`
*   `ROAS`
*   `Impressions`

**Step 4: Run the Bid Optimizer Script and Get Your Output File**

1.  **Ensure all files are in your `AmazonBidOptimizer` folder:** `bid_optimizer.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `yourinput_file.csv`.
2.  **Open VSCode and your `AmazonBidOptimizer` folder.**
3.  **Open the VSCode Terminal** (View -> Terminal).
4.  **Run the script by typing this command in the Terminal and pressing Enter:**

    ```bash
    python bid_optimizer.py
    ```

5.  **Wait for the script to finish.** Look for the "Success" messages in the Terminal:

    ```
    Successfully processed the data!
    Output file saved to: youroutput_file.csv
    PDF instruction file saved to: ppc_manager_guide.pdf
    ```

**E. Output Files Generated by the Script - Your Bid Optimization Results**

After a successful run, the script will create **two output files** in your `AmazonBidOptimizer` folder:

1.  **`youroutput_file.csv`:** This is the main output file containing your Amazon data with **suggested "New Bid" values** and explanations for each bid change.  You will review this file and upload it to Amazon to apply the bid changes.  Open this file using a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets.

    *   **What to look for in `youroutput_file.csv` - Key Columns for PPC Managers:**
        *   **"New Bid" Column:**  The **most important column for you as a PPC manager!** This column contains the **suggested new bids** for your keywords and targets. These are the bids the script recommends you implement in Amazon.
        *   **"Increase or decrease" Column:**  A quick indicator of whether the script suggests raising or lowering the current bid.
        *   **"Why" Column:**  **Crucial for understanding the script's logic!** Explains the **reason** behind each bid change suggestion.  This helps you understand *why* the script thinks a bid adjustment is needed (e.g., "Cost but No Revenue", "High ACOS but Overspending", "ROAS > 4, Orders > 1, Clicks > 20").
        *   **"Goal" Column:**  States the overall *optimization goal* for each bid change (e.g., "To Decrease Acos", "To Increase Sales").
        *   **"How much" Column:**  Shows the *amount* by which the bid is suggested to change (e.g., "Decreased bids by 0.10 cents").
        *   **"Changes" and "% changes" Columns:**  Provide numerical values for the bid change amount and percentage.

2.  **`ppc_manager_guide.pdf`:** This is a **PDF instruction file** specifically designed for PPC managers. It provides a quick, actionable guide on how to understand and use the `youroutput_file.csv` to implement the bid optimization suggestions in your Amazon campaigns. **Open this PDF file for step-by-step instructions on using the `youroutput_file.csv` output effectively in your PPC workflow.**

**F. Next Steps: Review Output, Upload to Amazon, and Monitor Performance**

1.  **Open `youroutput_file.csv` in a spreadsheet program (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.).**
2.  **Review the "New Bid" column and the "Why" explanations. **This is where you make informed decisions based on the script's suggestions and your PPC expertise.**
3.  **(Optional) Manually adjust "New Bid" values if needed based on your expert knowledge and strategic goals.**  **Remember, the script is a tool to assist you, but your PPC management expertise is essential!**
4.  **Save the modified `youroutput_file.csv` file.**
5.  **Upload `youroutput_file.csv` to Amazon Bulksheets to apply the bid changes to your live campaigns.**
6.  **Monitor your Amazon Sponsored Products campaign performance regularly and closely** to track the impact of the bid optimizations.  Pay close attention to metrics like ROAS, ACOS, Sales, and Impressions.
